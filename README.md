## Butter will butt your layers together.

The plugin fills the gap between the "Align" tool and the "Distribute" tool. Instead of aligning to a single axis or distributing the objects evenly, I wanted to butt objects together, removing any whitespace or overlaps between them.

**NEW** *Space selection command*

Distribute selected layers in a direction by specifying the amount of spacing between each layer.


## Install with Sketch Runner

With Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` command and search for `butter`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).
