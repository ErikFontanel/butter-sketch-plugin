# Butter Sketch Plugin

## Butter will butt your layers together.

The plugin fills the gap between the "Align" tool and the "Distribute" tool. Instead of aligning to a single axis or distributing the objects evenly, I wanted to butt objects together, removing any whitespace or overlaps between them.
